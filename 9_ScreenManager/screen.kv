    # NoTransition - switches screens instantly with no animation
    # SlideTransition - slide the screen in/out, from any direction
    # CardTransition - new screen slides on the previous or the old one slides off the new one depending on the mode
    # SwapTransition - implementation of the iOS swap transition
    # FadeTransition - shader to fade the screen in/out
    # WipeTransition - shader to wipe the screens from right to left
    # FallOutTransition - shader where the old screen ‘falls’ and becomes transparent, revealing the new one behind it.
    # RiseInTransition - shader where the new screen rises from the screen centre while fading from transparent to opaque.

        # duration¶
    # Duration in seconds of the transition, replacing the default of TransitionBase.
    # duration = NumericProperty(150) and defaults to .15 (= 150ms).
